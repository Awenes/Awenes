# Hi, I'm Precious

Software Engineer with a strong focus on **scalable systems, frontend architecture, and engineering rigor**.
I build production-grade applications with an emphasis on **performance, maintainability, and clear architectural trade-offs**.

I optimize for **long-term system health**, not short-term demos.

## Engineering Focus

* **Frontend Systems**

  * React, TypeScript, component architecture, performance optimization
  * State management, rendering behavior, and UX correctness at scale

* **System Design**

  * API contracts, data modeling, separation of concerns
  * Trade-off driven decisions under real-world constraints

* **AI-Integrated Products**

  * Practical LLM integrations focused on augmentation, not automation theater
  * Emphasis on reliability, observability, and cost-awareness

## Selected Work

* **Scribe – Developer Productivity Platform (VS Code Extension)**
  Designed and built a workspace-aware activity tracking system that logs developer behavior, auto-generates daily and weekly summaries, commits structured progress to GitHub, and supports snapshot diffing and restoration.

* **Enterprise Web Applications**
  Contributed to internal and customer-facing systems across finance, telecom, and edtech, focusing on frontend architecture, component reuse, and performance.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages:** TypeScript, JavaScript, C#
* **Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Node.js, ASP.NET
* **Data:** MongoDB, SQL
* **Tooling:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

## Current Interests

* Large-scale frontend architecture
* Performance profiling and optimization
* AI-assisted developer tooling
